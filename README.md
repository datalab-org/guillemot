LLM and AI-assisted explorations into fitting of experimental diffraction data, coming at you from Team [*datalab*](https://github.com/datalab-org) for the 2025 LLM hackathon.

</div>

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables in `.env`:
   ```bash
   AI_MODEL=google-gla:gemini-2.5-flash-lite
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the chat application:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Available Commands

- **Chat normally**: Just type your message and press Enter
- **Image analysis**: Include image URLs or local file paths in your message
  - `"Describe this image: https://example.com/photo.jpg"`
  - `"What's in this picture? /path/to/local/image.png"`
- **`history`**: View recent conversation history (🖼️ indicates messages with images)
- **`clear`**: Clear conversation history
- **`quit`**, **`exit`**, or **`bye`**: Exit the application

### Tool Usage

Currently includes a dummy tool as a placeholder. Responds to:
- "Can you use a tool to get some data?"
- "Please call the dummy tool with 'test query'"

### Image Analysis

The app supports multimodal image input. You can:

**Analyze images from URLs:**
```
Describe this logo: https://example.com/logo.png
What colors are in this image? https://example.com/photo.jpg
```

**Analyze local image files:**
```
What's in this photo? /Users/username/Pictures/vacation.jpg
Analyze this screenshot: ./screenshot.png
```

**Supported formats:** JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WebP

The AI can describe images, identify objects, read text in images, analyze colors, and answer questions about image content.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **ConversationHistory**: Manages chat memory and context with image tracking
- **Agent**: pydantic-ai agent with tool support and multimodal capabilities
- **Image Processing**: URL and local file image loading with multiple format support
- **Interactive Loop**: Clean terminal-based chat experience

### Tool System

The dummy tool demonstrates how to integrate external functionality:

```python
def dummy_tool(query: str) -> DummyToolResult:
    """Example tool that returns structured data"""
    return DummyToolResult(
        result="This is a dummy response! The tool is working correctly.",
        timestamp=datetime.now().isoformat(),
        input_received=query
    )
```

To add real tools, replace or extend this function with actual API calls, database queries, or other external services.

### Memory System

The conversation history is maintained in memory and provides context to the AI:
- Stores user and assistant messages with timestamps
- Formats recent messages for AI context
- Configurable history limits

## Extending the Application

### Adding New Tools

1. Create a new tool function:
   ```python
   def weather_tool(location: str) -> WeatherResult:
       # Your tool implementation
       pass
   ```

2. Add it to the agent:
   ```python
   agent = Agent(
       model_name,
       tools=[dummy_tool, weather_tool],
       # ... other config
   )
   ```

### Customizing the AI Behavior

Modify the `system_prompt` in the `create_agent()` function to change how the AI behaves.

### Persisting Conversation History

Currently, history is stored in memory. To persist across sessions, modify the `ConversationHistory` class to save/load from a file or database.

## Dependencies

- `pydantic-ai`: LLM framework with structured outputs and tool support
